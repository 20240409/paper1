# A Multi-Stage Learning Framework Integrating Reconstruction and Classification for Region-Level EEG-Based Fatigue Detection
This repository provides the implementation of our paper on EEG-based fatigue detection. We propose a multi-stage learning framework that integrates joint pre-training and supervised fine-tuning to improve fatigue recognition performance.
